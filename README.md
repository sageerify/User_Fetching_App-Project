# Random User Fetcher App
   
This project is a small and very simple interactive application designed to fetch random users from an API and provide options to filter users by gender and view detailed user information.

## Features
     
1. **Fetch Random Users**  
   - A "Fetch Users" button triggers an API call to fetch a list of random users.  
   - Users are displayed in cards, showing their basic information like name, gender, and avatar.  

2. **Gender Filter**  
   - Two buttons, **Male** and **Female**, filter the displayed users by gender.  
   - Clicking either button dynamically updates the list to show only users of the selected gender.

3. **View User Details**  
   - Each user card has a **View Details** button.  
   - Clicking it opens a detailed view of the selected user, displaying additional information like email, location, and phone number.  
   - A **Back** button allows users to return to the main screen.
